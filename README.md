## Archived
This module is not active anymore. Most functionality is included in Fork CMS by default now. You can go to a page and go to the Image tab and upload a page image there and use it in your theme layout. 

## Description
The Fork CMS Backgrounds module let's you add backgrounds to your Fork CMS site. Upload a background, set the css options (background-size: cover, background-repeat, background-position, ...). For every background, a new widget is generated that you can insert anywhere on your Fork CMS site. 

I use this module to insert a background inside a header block. An example can be seen [here](http://www.woestyne.be/nl/feestzalen) in the header.

You can see a live example [here](http://www.woestyne.be/nl/feestzalen) in the header.

## Installation

1. Upload the `/src/Backend/Modules/Backgrounds` folder to your `/src/Backend/Modules` folder and your `/src/Frontend/Modules/Backgrounds ` folder to `/src/Frontend/Modules` folder.
3. Browse to your Fork CMS backend site.
4. Go to `Settings > Modules`. Click on the install button next to the backgrounds module.
5. Have fun!

## HTML & CSS

The widget generates a div. To set the div as a background, I used some css. [Here's a quick codepen example](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwjqVN) to do this for a page header.

## Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, please create an issue and I'll try to fix it (or feel free to fix it yourself with a pull-request).
